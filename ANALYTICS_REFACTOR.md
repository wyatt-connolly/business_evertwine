# Analytics Refactoring Summary

## 🚀 **What Was Changed**

Refactored the analytics system from **3 separate collections** to **1 unified collection** with type fields.

## 📊 **Before (3 Collections)**

- `analytics_views/{id}` - View tracking
- `analytics_engagement/{id}` - Engagement tracking
- `analytics_summary/{id}` - Aggregated metrics

## ✨ **After (1 Collection)**

- `analytics/{id}` with `type` field:
  - `type: "view"` - View events
  - `type: "engagement"` - Engagement events
  - `type: "summary"` - Aggregated metrics

## 🔧 **Benefits of Single Collection**

1. **Simpler Firestore Rules** - Only need rules for one collection
2. **Better Performance** - Fewer collection references
3. **Easier Queries** - `where("type", "==", "view")` instead of separate collections
4. **Cleaner Code** - One service handles all analytics
5. **Atomic Operations** - Can update multiple analytics types in one transaction

## 📁 **Files Updated**

### Core Analytics Service

- `/src/lib/analytics.ts`
  - ✅ New `AnalyticsDocument` interface with `type` field
  - ✅ Updated all methods to use single collection
  - ✅ Improved TypeScript typing with type guards
  - ✅ Fixed all collection references

### React Hooks

- `/src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`
  - ✅ Updated type imports
  - ✅ Fixed all type references

### Firestore Rules

- `/firestore.rules.single-analytics`
  - ✅ Simplified rules for single collection
  - ✅ Proper business user authentication
  - ✅ Anonymous view tracking allowed

## 🔒 **Updated Security Rules**

```javascript
// Single Analytics Collection - Much Simpler!
match /analytics/{analyticsId} {
  // Allow read for business owners
  allow read: if request.auth != null
    && resource.data.businessId == request.auth.uid;

  // Allow write for anyone (anonymous tracking allowed)
  allow create: if request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['type', 'meetupId', 'businessId', 'timestamp']);

  // Business owners can update/delete their analytics
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null
    && resource.data.businessId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## 🎯 **How to Apply**

1. **Copy the new Firestore rules** from `firestore.rules.single-analytics`
2. **Paste into Firebase Console** → Firestore Database → Rules
3. **Publish the rules**
4. **Test analytics** - the system will work immediately!

## 📊 **Document Structure Examples**

### View Event

```typescript
{
  type: "view",
  meetupId: "meetup_123",
  businessId: "business_456",
  viewerId: "user_789",
  isUnique: true,
  viewDuration: 120,
  source: "search",
  deviceType: "mobile",
  timestamp: Firestore.Timestamp
}
```

### Engagement Event

```typescript
{
  type: "engagement",
  meetupId: "meetup_123",
  businessId: "business_456",
  eventType: "click",
  eventData: { action: "edit_meetup" },
  timestamp: Firestore.Timestamp
}
```

### Summary Event

```typescript
{
  type: "summary",
  meetupId: "meetup_123",
  businessId: "business_456",
  totalImpressions: 150,
  uniqueViewers: 75,
  clicks: 25,
  avgViewDuration: 95,
  timestamp: Firestore.Timestamp
}
```

## ✅ **No Breaking Changes**

- All existing analytics functions work the same
- All React hooks maintain the same API
- Dashboard components don't need updates
- Only backend implementation changed

The refactoring is **complete and ready to use**! 🎉
